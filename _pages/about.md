I am currently working at [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov/) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Prof. [Hui Li](http://t2.lanl.gov/astrophysics/hli/). Before I came to LANL, I obtained my PhD degree from [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm) in Xiamen University(https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and then worked at [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO)](http://english.shao.cas.cn/) as a PostDoc between 2016-2018 with Prof. [Feng Yuan](http://202.127.29.4/fyuan/index.html). My research interest mainly focuses on gas/dust dynamics in protoplanetary disk, planet formation, black hole accretion, and AGN feedback with theoretical and numerical methods.







How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
