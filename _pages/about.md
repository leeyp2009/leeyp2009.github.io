I am currently working at [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov/) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Prof. [Hui Li](http://t2.lanl.gov/astrophysics/hli/). Before I came to LANL, I obtained my PhD degree from [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm) in [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and then worked at [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO)](http://english.shao.cas.cn/) as a PostDoc between 2016-2018 with Prof. [Feng Yuan](http://202.127.29.4/fyuan/index.html). My research interest mainly focuses on gas/dust dynamics in protoplanetary disk, planet formation, black hole accretion, and AGN feedback with theoretical and numerical methods.
